		<h1>Why I am in Web Design</h1>
<p> Right now, I'm enrolled in Web Design. I took this class because I liked when we did the coding unit in Multimedia 1. I would say I have become very good with coding in HTML. I also picked web design because my dad is into computers and technology.</p>

	<h1>Can coding skills be handy?</h1>
	<p>Coding skills can be very useful later in life. They can be used if someone needs you to make a website for them, or a least do the coding for it. It can also be useful if you have a job that needs you to make a code for them.
